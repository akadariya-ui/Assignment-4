            <img src= "/images/project1.jpg" alt="Project 1">
            <p>This project focuses on addressing various aspects of climate change through innovative and comprehensive solutions. Climate change is one of the most pressing global challenges, leading to rising temperatures, sea level rise, extreme weather events, and widespread ecological disruptions. This project works across multiple sectors including agriculture, waste management, energy efficiency, and environmental education to develop holistic strategies that can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote sustainable practices.</p>

            <img src= "/images/project2.jpg" alt="Project 2">
            <p>This project is centered on accelerating the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources, with a special focus on green energy development. Fossil fuels have long been the dominant energy source globally, but they contribute heavily to carbon emissions and environmental degradation. This project aims to reduce dependency on fossil fuels by promoting the development and widespread adoption of clean, sustainable energy technologies such as solar, wind, hydroelectric, and geothermal power.</p>

            <h4>Project 3</h4>
            <img src="/images/project3.jpg" alt="Project 3">
            <p>Urban design also plays a critical role, with a focus on building compact, walkable cities that reduce the need for long car trips and promote active transportation modes like walking and biking. Public education campaigns emphasize the personal and environmental benefits of shifting to sustainable transportation options. By addressing technological, policy, and behavioral dimensions, this project strives to create modern, accessible, and eco-friendly transportation systems that contribute to cleaner air, reduced traffic congestion, and improved quality of life.</p>
