                <p>
   My name is Alish Kadariya. I am from Nepal, the beautiful country of mountains, nature, and rich cultural heritage. 
    I come from Kathmandu, famously known as the "City of Temples," where tradition blends with modern life in a truly unique way. 
    Currently, I am studying Computer Programming at Seneca College, Canada. 
    <br><br>
    My passion lies in exploring the world of technology, software, and coding. I have always been fascinated by how software can solve real-world problems and bring ideas to life. 
    Working with code allows me to build solutions, automate tasks, and create projects that can help people and businesses operate more efficiently. 
    <br><br>
    In my free time, I enjoy playing guitar and travelling to new places. Travelling gives me a chance to experience different cultures, meet new people, and gain inspiration for my personal growth. 
    Music, on the other hand, is my way to relax and express creativity beyond coding. 
    <br><br>
    As I continue my studies, I aim to expand my knowledge in full-stack development, software engineering, and cloud technologies. 
    My goal is to build meaningful software applications that not only function well but also create positive impact for users and communities.
